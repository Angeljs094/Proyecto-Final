(btw, he didn't charge us for the extra cheese, which i'm pretty sure is illegal)",2019,9,22

she never told me she couldn't honor the coupon, she just tried to overcharge me.  this is completely unacceptable.  

is this some sort of scam where the cashier overcharges then keeps the difference?  i won't return to this store and its a shame as i live only 3 blocks away.  i've experienced poor service at this location a number of times now aside from today.

5gcdiAbxI1ciMsu2DgCkJA,VZzivJEbmHItOxNXJB3SpA,1.0,"for the love of meatballs lined up on a baguette. i'm still in the shock and awe stage of ""what did i just witness?"". i was at this subway at 6:17pm tonight. the air outside was chilly but nothing compared to the wrath of m. the woman in front me had 2 small kids with her who were running around the restaurant as chillens do. she had some coupons and the order was complicated because her kids are picky eaters (weird right). just bread with no filling then ham, bacon and pepperoni slices on the side - okay so it wasn't complicated. apparently the shift lead who we can refer to as ""m"" just wasn't having it. she was training a guy named tyler as it was his first day. some of the highlight reel is as follows:

""the ham is right here. they just call it black forest ham to make it seem fancy or something. it's just ham.""

""i can't toast half your sandwich and not toast the other half. you're just trying to be cheap with your coupons."" 

""well we're a franchise so if i make this sandwich the way you want me to, my boss will end up chewing me out when they're looking at the inventory.""

""i don't care go ahead and get me fired.""

m's bad attitude ended up making a child cry and the woman in front of me who kept giving her multiple (too many) chances to just make the sandwich she ordered, ended up walking out of the restaurant sans sandwich with her kids.

during this whole exchange, tyler and i looked on uncomfortably. while m was off terrorizing this family over some meat slices, i coached him through my meatball marinara. he did a truly stellar job - maybe make him shift lead as his customer service skills were fine.

brentwood i expect better from you. looking at other yelp reviews i sense a theme of an employee with a bad attitude. i have no interest in bringing business to owners who choose to look the other way with this beyond poor display of customer service. needless to say i won't be coming back to this location. i only like drama when it's being shown on a rerun episode of vampire diaries.

i tend to like a heavy amount of vegetables on my sandwich. when i visit this location it is almost like pulling teeth to get extra anything. i would have to ask multiple times to get extra on a sandwich and it's is clear that the employees are annoyed that you're wanting extra on your sandwich.

maybe twice that i've gone i used a coupon. the first time they noticed i had one and it was even harder to get extra vegetables on the sandwich and you can see from the expressions and attitude they are unhappy that you're using it. the second time i saved it to the end to say i had a coupon. the employee seemed really annoyed that i hadn't told them upfront and then turned to another employee and was speaking, what seemed very angrily, to the other employee. then rang in my discount and unhappily handed me my food. 

i've made attempts at filling out the surveys and complaining to corporate in an effort to achieve better experiences at this location. they've apologized, but i've seen no changed behavior.

the last time i visited the location was months ago. today i placed a mobile order in an effort to not have to deal with the unfriendliness of the staff. when i picked up my order the guy was upset and referred to my sandwich as ""messy! messy! messy!"" he even stated ""there was extra, extra, extra for everything."" i was so embarrassed.

the only employee we encountered had ear buds in and was having a full conversation with someone - not us.  i actually thought he was talking to us at first, but then felt like an idiot when i realized i was interrupting his conversation by answering his questions to his phone buddy.

once my girlie had her food we found a table and realized it was sort of gross. we tried another. same deal.  it wasn't ""land fill"" dirty, but is wasn't clean. i wiped it off and she ate on her sandwich wrapping paper.

my daughter had a meal deal and i refrained as there was a frozen pot pie with my name on it at home. she immediately noted that the bread wasn't ""right"". she thought maybe it was stale.  next came the cookies. they were fully crunchy. not just the ends like the normal subway fare. not cool.

i needed to stop in to walmart on my lunch break to get some important items. figured i'd just grab a quick sub while i was there and take it back to work... boy was i mistaken.

there was only one employee working during lunch rush. she was extremely slow, so slow it took nearly 30 minutes to serve the three people in front of me.

when i finally did get to the counter, we told her what subs we wanted... then her phone rang.

after all that wait she had the audacity to take a personal phone call right in front of us. she even turned and walked away from the counter to carry on her conversation. 

she was on the call so long that i could no longer wait as i had to get back to work. we had to leave, no lunch for me today.

this subway is as shady as the dingy walmart where it is located. the only reason i gave it two stars is so that the review wouldn't be hidden.

XJqROiuFgSYwlw3-2nAI-g,HDQGViGXTflhNta6Da1eZw,3.0,"haven't had much success from restaurants these days. and yes, i do take into consideration covid-19 role in messing things around. i'm trying to support my local restaurants, but these last couple of times have let me down. it's very frustrating!

to sum things up, my family and i ordered delivery via uber eats for the first time. the ue driver did fine. no complaints there. she followed directions perfectly.

the problem was with the order from the restaurant itself. as a matter if fact, we ordered four sandwiches and all four of them had at least one thing wrong! that is a horrible percentage!

what i concluded is that they were either out of the ingredients to make the type of bread we ordered or they ran out of the pre-baked loaves and the new ones weren't ready to come out of the oven when our orders came in. three out of four of our sandwiches were supposed to be with the italian herbs & cheese bread, but instead, subway made all the sandwiches with plain italian bread.

the other problem was not getting our choices of cheese for each sandwich. two sandwiches were correct, but they totally skipped putting the pepper jack cheese we ordered onto the other two. again, maybe they were out, but they made no effort to contact us to select another option or to cancel our orders and try something else.

that, however, didn't stop them from charging us for our order.

needless to say, this experience is going to make me think twice about ordering from this location again. there's something to be said about how you treat your customers and do what's right versus settling for less, and offering poor service instead.

this story boils down to me taking a paper cup that i thought was a water cup. it wasn't. the girls behind the counter then went berserk, only they did so five or 10 minutes later - confusingly enough - after my husband and i sat down with our two small children.

long story short: my apology wouldn't cut it. my offer of cash didn't cut it. cash on the table when we left also didn't cut it. but one of the girls did yell, among other things, that we should never come back. (y'all, i give you my word that i'm not exaggerating here. just ...  wow.)
 
other customers saw what went down and were as baffled as we were. ""outraged"" was the word one guy used, actually. two people told me they'd never eat there again. another couple walked back out the door before they even got in line, saying, ""we need to get out of here now.""

the new employee, was visibly nervous and sweating heavily began working on my sandwich after finishing up with the other customer. when i asked him ""hey which one are you working on?"" because i had a concern he was going to make a mistake, he replied, ""uh...i'm working on the 3rd one. i've already finished the 1st and the 2nd"" i was confused by this but i decided to let him finish up. he then gave me a bag containing 3 sandwiches with a receipt sloppily thrown in the bag. i asked him ""am i supposed to sign something?"" to which he responded ""no you're good""

i've never seen more than 2 staff working at a time... which is not uncommon for subway, but this location seems to do a lot of skip/app orders.  they will stop in the middle of making your sub, to go get the ipad, print out an order and start making it.  they don't care how many people are standing in their store, they will drop everything for an online order.  maybe they have timelines they need to meet or something, i dunno.  but it sucks for the people who went in person.

we've had issues in the past with staff not listening, and we have to repeat our order multiple times (more often than not it's because they get distracted by an online order coming in, or their coworker telling them something in the middle of you ordering).  the customer in front of them is never the focus or priority.

i ordered a chicken breast sandwich. the one that's on sale right now. they asked me what cheese like normal l, heat the breast up in the microwave before toasting it, like they were supposed to. then an older woman asked me what kind of sauce i wanted on it and i said mayonnaise and honey mustard. she reached for and put on light mayo. i stopped and asked, is that light mayo? she said ""we put light mayo on always unless they ask otherwise.""
hmm.. funny that they didn't do that when i worked there. if they say mayo, you do mayo. if they want light mayo... they'll ask for it. 
i told her i didn't like light mayo. she asked me if i wanted her to scrape it off with her knife...as she began trying to scrape off sauce, taking cheese with it.
i told her i'd like a new one because that one was now grossing my out. with attitude she says, ""ooooooook.""
then when they went to remake it, they didn't heat the chicken breast up in the microwave first, like they're supposed to. they just threw it in the toaster and the chicken was cold.

i'll give them two stars instead of one because they were fast, and the service was friendly, (the gal was downright cheerful as she explained that if i wanted to use a coupon i'd get the most bare bones sandwich they could make, and i'd also have to buy chips and a drink with it.)  but, honestly, i'm not gonna be back.  subway's nothing more than mediocre fast food-style subs to begin with, which is fine if the price is right.  but, unless you're using a coupon, or taking advantage of a special...  they're really not much, if any, cheaper than a sandwich from a better quality, not fast-food, shop.

the shop itself was exceptionally clean, and the counter person friendly as she completed my order after my arrival. she was generous with the accoutrements, and therein lay the problem. there was so much being stuffed into the torpedo that in wrapping up in waxed sandwich paper, i could see it starting to leak around the edges. upon unwrapping at my desk, the excess moisture was escaping, and rivulets of sauce were flowing everywhere. with each bite food was evacuating out the back door, and my hands were getting drenched. the supply of thin non-absorbent napkins was quickly exhausted, and my fingers dripping and sticky.

AbDzwL6cNy9G_FRXcDT9hg,QZ5p6y3f3qd59QCIWEOx-w,1.0,"the management of this store pulls a bait and switch with their sign that advertises ""two footlongs for $9.99"" and then in smaller print it says ""after 4:00 pm.""

they leave the sign out all day. people come in, order, find out that their order is not $9.99. the management points at the sign and says ""only after 4:00.""

this is totally fair. it is up to the customer to read the entire sign.

what is not fair is that after 4:00 the management brings the sign in and sets it right inside the window. now the customer can still see the ""two footlongs for $9.99."" but after ordering is told that the subs are not $9.99 and that the sign is not valid as it is not inside.

i've observed them doing this on many days when i was on my way past in the afternoon, then returned to grab dinner (after 4:00) before heading home.

when i mentioned to them that the sign was still clearly visible from the street and thereby luring customers in with a fake deal, the owner said ""indoor signs don't count. only outdoor signs.""

its not ok, now you will serve those onions to the other people.
she said, ""i will take care of it, i cant take anything else today""
she said, ""its ok , i will take care of it.""
i said, no its its not ok at all. i have to say for her to wear gloves to touch the food you serve to us, especially nowadays.

upon arrival, my manager promptly explained he hadn't ordered his food just yet because he didn't want to be rude and gnaw at his meal while we chatted quickly. we were probably there maybe five-ish minutes before a older black woman came to our table and curtly said, ""if you guys aren't ordering food, you can't take up this table"". i was immediately taken aback because i couldn't understand why she was being so rude, i, legitimately, was speechless. my manager explained to the woman (who i later found out is named nicki) that he planned to order but hadn't just yet. she then expressed that i couldn't have ""outside food"" and my manager told her i had no intention of staying long. mind you, he spoke for me because i was still stuck at the fact that she had zero curtouesy or couth. nicki then walked away and approached her coworker (who i now know is named erika). my manager turned to me and continued the conversation.

a couple more minutes passed and i noticed nicki and erika kept glancing at me from behind the counter all the while half whispering to each other about how they're going to kick me out, how i'm over here smiling while i need to get the hell out, etc., basically, talking trash. mind you, they were talking to each other not so low in front of another customer who keep glancing back at me. after a little while, i got out of my seat and went to the counter with the intention to buy a cookie to resolve they're trash talking. i moved so intently, i had forgetten to put on my mask to which they hollered at me to put it on; so i did. they then yelled and said, i needed to step back further away from the counter; to which i did. after the rang out the customer who was at the counter the whole time, i told the women that i'll buy a cookie if that will keep them from loudly trash talking. erika and nicki changed their tune and tried to make the situation a bit me having a ""outside drink/food"" in the subway and how chrevron has the same rule. i, honestly, wanted to dig more into them and demand a manager, however my own manager came to the rescue and attemtped to disfuse to situation by preordering his sandwich. i returned to my seat furious and left a little while later.

i'm still trying to understand what cause this chain of events; is it truly over me drinking jamba juice in a subway????? what was the reason erika and nicki?

after i left, i called the store to acquire their names but i knew i had to finesse them. as soon as they answered the phone, one of the ladies answered so maliciously and bitterly until i made the request for name in order to compliment them (again, the woman changed her tune). i found out erika (the woman with the half red/half balcony hair was a manager!!) after submitting my global.subway.com survey, i received multiple calls from a restricted number. i recieved about two or three until i call out ""erika? nicki?"" to which they responded with a disconnected call and no calls after.

i have never been targeted the way they targeted me. i'm still stunned this was all (by their own admission) because i brought jamba juice into a subway store. was it worth it ladies? it's a shame because they keep the store up beautifully, but their disgusting attitudes will eventually aid them in losing their jobs. i know for a fact, they wouldn't ever want to be treated the way they treated me.

     i walk in there yesterday at 3:40 pm to purchase a chocolate chip cookie as i was on my way downtown. i pull out a 20 dollar bill and he ask me how many cookies? i day just one boss, ( needed exact change for bus fare, not that it matters) . he says no man give me a ten very rudly. i said excuse me , because for one there is sort of a language barrier , for second , he was rude about it. anyway i tell him i only want one cookie, and he refused to sell me just one cookie , he was trying to extort me into buying more than one. 
     i can understand not wanting me to just come in and ask to break the 20$ bill down for me without a purchase, but i never asked for that , one chocolate chip cookie please, were the first words out of my mouth. and i can also understand not being able to break a 100$ or 50$ bill, or maybe not changing the 20$ bill when they first opened for the day , but it was 3:30pm , if you are running a business , especially in the realm of fast food/ restaurant business , and you can not change a 20$ dollar bill for a customer, it's absolutely ridiculous, and you shouldn't be in business. i find that as extortion because he wanted me to spend more money. dont sell single cookies, if you going to get upset when some customer comes in to purchase a single cookie!
     i have eaten here probably 12 times in 1 1/2 months , since i moved over here, and i guarantee i never go to eat here again. you just lost a little customer 
for life. i will never ever spend another apenny in your place. i will tell everyone that iwill listen to not spend a penny in your place and i will use every rout i can on social media to let everyone know how rude you are and how terribly  your establishment is being run.

Ej1QkmrOsVsaTyaDBDxTWA,nqsrL6BuIevb285dbdXjjA,1.0,"hygiene concerns from workers:
we generally come to this subway store at least 2-3 times per week and historically have no complaints.    it's subway, and you know what to expect after all.
however, we've been noticing a really bad trend lately whereby the workers are inadvertently contaminating food surfaces and sandwiches after they come in contact with ipad devices.   
let me explain....
the workers are very busy and are making sandwiches for customers that arrive.  however, they evidently also are responsible for taking incoming grubhub, and other online delivery service orders at the same time.     well, on monday evening this week, we came in and saw two two male workers behind the counter.   the younger of the two workers does not have a beard.  he looks to be about 19-20 and has always been friendly.    however, there was another worker who has a trimmed beard (and is slightly older) and black hair who we assume is the on duty lead or manager.  he is older.    when we arrived, there were two customers ahead of us.  we went to jump in line, but as i waited i watched as the bearded manager type man placed the dirty ipad device on the sandwich slider board right next to the sandwiches that he made for customers.    he did not place it on a piece of paper, but directly on the sandwich board and right in between two sandwiches he was making.   to make matters worse, he often touched the ipad screen with his gloved fingers and then continued to grab sandwich toppings and meats with the same gloved hands.   
this is not a solitary occurrence.   we have seen a trend whereby the workers are constantly grabbing those same ipad devices.    this places the customer at risk for food borne illness.  it is well documented that ipads and cell phones are literally one of the most highly contaminated surfaces/devices out there.   workers should know not to take touch other objects or devices when managing food.   they should also never place an ipad device on a sandwich board that is used for food items.   these are blatant health code issues and i am now sad because there are a number of workers at this subway who have been sweet and greeted us kindly and for whom we have had no issues.   however, again, recently with this start of having to take delivery orders, we have noticed that even some of the sweet workers are hurrying and not thinking about these types of hygiene issues.    this is not a solitary occurrence, but was the straw that broke the camels back.  so, we left right then and there and went to another local restaurant.

i have been here multiple times and i've visited at different times of the day; most of the time that i come here, there are more guests waiting to order while the only two workers there are already busy. the workers frequently go back and forth between the deli area and the back of the restaurant grabbing more ingredients while frantically finishing orders; there should be another worker for this purpose.

this is the poorest management of a restaurant i've ever witnessed; most subways i've ever been to staff 3 or 4 people minimum and this location tries to operate on only 2, but sometimes i've seen just 1 and sometimes they're alone in the middle of the day. this location staffs people who appear to be minors completely on their own. a manager is never present here at any given time; i have never met the manager or been told they were present at the restaurant.

to keep food costs down the owner uses less meat than your supposed to according to the subway guidelines.

order any sandwich and open it up and you'll see the meat is about half what it is at any other subway.

if you order spinach, he will say that he is out of spinach and substitute lettuce (because it's cheaper), even though you can see the spinach in the sandwich station and your subway is inside a walmart. if you really were out of an ingredient you could walk ten feet and buy it from the produce section.

i eat subway 3-5 times a week and notice that the quality varies tremendously from one subway to the next because they are franchised.

this is probably the worst one in the entire city.

the reviews reflect this.

i purchased food through the app, which for me has been glitchy, often freezing or crashing. somehow i marked the pickup time as 4:50 instead of asap.

when i went to pick up my food i was told i had to wait over two hours to even cancel the order, or i could re-order the food and pay again and cancel later.

i literally had a receipt, an order number, the location, and the app literally tells you to contact the store to cancel orders.

they told me to call subway customer service, except there is no way to contact them quickly as the phone leads to an automated directory that tells you to go online.

instead of helping out a recurring customer, the employee decided to prioritize the $24 charge and the possibility of me ripping them off (even though i was using the app). he said, ""i don't have the order and my boss (whom he had contacted on the phone) says i can't make sandwiches unless they're in the computer.""

i asked him to call his boss one more time, which he did and spoke in another language this time, which i think in a customer service role is rude as there is no way for a customer to know what is being said. he repeated the same answer to me about the computer and being unable to make the sandwiches that i'd already paid for.

i told him he could literally just make the sandwiches and i'd be gone, as i've already paid and the only way i can cancel is by calling the store.

he decided to prioritize a $24 charge that will be canceled over a recurring customer. not a very business savvy move, and bad customer service.

YzkW_IrpA0vvta0WbkgGIg,3eh3fHpfOBj6agJxvjtYjQ,1.0,"i knew something was wrong the minute i stepped into the subway sandwich shop beside kroger's on thompson lane. one sad middle-aged man sat at a corner table facing the wall, hovering over his cold cut combo as if he had been scolded for buying it. he was doubtless still dealing with the malignant treatment from the staff that i, myself, was about to receive. 

the man in the red subway shirt was scowling at me before i even approached the counter. the woman to his left was gazing angrily at nothing in particular about an arm's length from her nose. 

after making my meat and bread choices, i watched the man sling my sandwich toward the woman with the passive aggression of a luggage handler at heathrow. 

and i wondered what my sandwich ever did to him. i hadn't officially met the sandwich yet, but it seemed like a fine sandwich to me -- pleasant, in fact, not hurting anyone. i began to feel sorry for it. how could i eat this sandwhich now, given my sudden escalated empathy? 

the man's attitude was matched and raised by his coworker who wordlessly gazed through me while i listed my preferred ingredients. her blank, unfriendly countenance seemed to articulate her deepest feelings that i and everyone in this place was there to take pieces of her mortal soul. 

as i slinked away with my food, i felt as if ordering this sandwich had been a personal insult to these hard working people. ordering this sandwich made me, not a customer supporting my local economy, but an oppressor, and i felt terrible for having done it, as if i had asked them, not to construct a tasty and nourishing subway concoction, but to lick the day's grime off my shoes. 

hunger overpowered my empathy, and i did eat the sandwich. but i could taste their dull disdain in the meat, cheese and vegetables - and not just theirs, but that of all subway workers. indeed i was chewing through the joyless angst of the working middle class everywhere. 

the obvious contempt thay have for their customers has given me all the indication i need to no longer cause these good, hard working people so much aggrivation and pain. there is another subway about a mile up thompson lane. and i'm not sure, but they seemed to like me there. or my $7.99 and that's kinda the same thing.",2019,3,19

i still finished my salad since it's subway and i know what to expect but it wasn't the best i have ever had and with the experience i went through with the employee that day i don't see myself coming back to this location. i will probably avoid it for awhile.",2019,12,4

ZJ2jcCWEpUiFy86Wg1ulcg,b2kjgx_Py8_mC8xXkTnRIg,2.0,"subway is best known for amazing and healthy sandwich alternatives to fast food right?  wouldn't you think it would be so much better if the employees were staffed properly for efficiency and they had all the tools to do their jobs?  well, this store location often has issues in two areas:  staffing and availability of ingredients. 

staffing on our visit yesterday was horrible and the guy handling everything would not be relieved or reinforced for at least 45-minutes by his own accord. who allows staffing to allow for one person when a properly run store has at least two on the line and maybe one in the back prepping additional resources?  the employee also said his manager left early for some reason, leaving him alone to fend for himself.   the line of people was out the door when we arrived and backed up again shortly after we sat down to eat the awesomeness he created. people were patient but with reluctance. and no autonomy to make people happy by offering a comp of some sort for the wait. 20-minutes to serve 3 in front of us before our turn and then the people behind us as well waited along for the ride and almost walked. 

ingredient availability is something that should never happen. in any retail or food industry you always order based on trends and also order to accommodate the unexpected. you lose less money if you have to throw something out vs not  selling anything at all if you don't have complete inventory to support your menu. any competent manager knows this!  they were out of everything from steak for their ultimate steak sandwich to a simple avocado for an add on sale we were prepared to purchase. when you want something specific, it makes it hard to have a plan b unless you're willing to settle. in this case, we settled. and the compromise with missing wants was decent but incomplete. 

two stars this visit. hopefully i can offer a better rating next visit.",2019,12,4

don't come hungry.

we planned on stopping at the wild garlic pizza pub once we got to the airport, but it was closed.  we ended up at the subway as the only alternative on the b concourse.  i guess we could have gone to mcdonald's, but i wouldn't feed that to my dog and we left him home.  after going through all of the things that subway didn't have.  meatballs, roast beef, and mayonnaise.  we ended up on tuna fish and american club, don't judge me, the kids chose.  they also asked for avocado on each sandwich and mozzarella for the american club.  the staff told me that it would be a small extra charge. ok! we ended up getting charged $2 or $3 for the avocado for each sub, they cost was different each time...not sure why.  the mozzarella was $4 extra.  the two subs and 2 bottled sodas ended up costing $44.

take this opportunity to fast or eat before you arrive.  the other options are better, if they are open, but stay away from subway, mcdonald's, and la brea (i learned that lesson on a previous trip).  reno tahoe international airport should take this opportunity to provide quality food from local vendors and get rid of the chains.  i am sure some of the local restaurants would love to have a venue.  the travelers would also be appreciative.

well, maybe it was a flaw. maybe the employee accidentally rang it up wrong. things happen, we are all human. but then when i said something about the $2.99 subs, the employee looked at me like i was mental. i pointed at the poster and she even looked at it like it wasn't there.... she then proceeded to ask the shift lead in the back about it. why is this hard? my response was that it was already rung up for the $2.99 deal. that it just comes out as $4.79. bull. if i wanted to get screwed for pricing i would go to a sketchy used car lot. have them add all the packages and warrantees and sign whatever they put in front of me.

i was rather upset i didn't get the right order at all last time but said nothing because we made it all the way home to an inaccurate order and it was too late, and i didn't want to complain because someone else took me out to lunch and i was there for the company not the food. i am not a chronic complainer, i try to give people the benefit of the doubt. 

i gave them another chance in good faith and they disappointed us again. wow. this is not typical of subways, they are usually accurate to the max at most locations, and healthier in general as far as fast food goes. 

i just wanted the meats and vegetables, no bread nor a bunch of fattening stuff, it wasn't a special order. 

what if i had a food allergy? would it then be okay to leave out what i asked for, and pile on something i don't want, need, or can't eat?

thankfully i don't, and i'm not that picky of a person, but i am on a very strict special diet now and if i paid close to $10 for something i expect to get what i paid for, not a ton of random packets thrown in the bag when i did not ask for those items, and it would taste terrible on the kind of food i purchased. 

please, subway manager, check in with your employees once in a while and see if they truly are listening to the customers. 

i asked for a particular dressing that is diet-friendly; they just weren't paying attention and again, we didn't notice until we left. 

i tried to call the manager to be nice and ask if it was maybe new worker, but they do not answer their listed phone number. 

i will not be back and will continue to wait to get to home to eat. i don't want to pay close to $10 for a few items slapped in a bowl.

i may try a different locale, as i have always gone to subways in several states and they are always good. i hope that this is not an indication of how this particular subway is run, but i see that they have a low rating in general so hopefully they will improve in the future for other customers.",2021,1,29
